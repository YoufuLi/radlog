The classes in this package will work, with the exception of FSMaxBased2SingleAggregateRelationNode, but UDAs for monotonic aggregates are not
 yet supported in the language (grammar).  Hence, the edu.ucla.cs.wis.bigdatalog.interpreter.pipelined.aggregate.fs package has better performance 
 and is the currently used package for monotonic aggregate execution.
